## 1. Introduction <a name="intro"></a>

- This is a project created for facial recognition. 

- This project contains of a [Convolutional Neural Network(CNN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network) model and it can be  trained for a dataset containing faces of the people that need to be detected/recognized by the model.

- After a model is trained for a dataset, it can be used to recognize faces that were part of the training dataset.
